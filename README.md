# Triggeryze

**[WIP]**

Triggeryze watches the AI's response and fires actions when keywords appear. It can stop the response mid-stream, replace words, run a background LLM call, generate an image, and chain the results of one action into the next — all driven by a list of rules you configure in the settings panel.

## What you get

**Automated cleanup.** Stop the AI from writing past a sentinel, strip it afterward, and resume without lifting a finger.

**Inline enrichment.** Fire a background LLM call the moment a keyword appears. By the time streaming ends, the result is usually already written into the message.

**Lorebook-aware triggers.** Fire rules when the AI writes any keyword from your active lorebooks — without maintaining a separate keyword list.

**Composable actions.** Stack actions in a single rule and pipe the output of one into the prompt of the next.
